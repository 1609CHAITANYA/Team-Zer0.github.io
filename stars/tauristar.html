            <p>T Tauri stars (TTS) are a class of variable stars that are less than about ten million years old.[1] This
                class is named after the prototype, T Tauri, a young star in the Taurus star-forming region. They are
                found near molecular clouds and identified by their optical variability and strong chromospheric lines.
                T Tauri stars are pre-main-sequence stars in the process of contracting to the main sequence along the
                Hayashi track, a luminosity–temperature relationship obeyed by infant stars of less than 3 solar masses
                (M☉) in the pre-main-sequence phase of stellar evolution. It ends when a star of 0.5 M☉ or larger
                develops a radiative zone, or when a smaller star commences nuclear fusion on the main sequence.</p>
            <p> T Tauri stars comprise the youngest visible F, G, K and M spectral type stars (2 M☉). Their surface
                temperatures are similar to those of main-sequence stars of the same mass, but they are significantly
                more luminous because their radii are larger. Their central temperatures are too low for hydrogen
                fusion. Instead, they are powered by gravitational energy released as the stars contract, while moving
                towards the main sequence, which they reach after about 100 million years. They typically rotate with a
                period between one and twelve days, compared to a month for the Sun, and are very active and
                variable.<br>There is evidence of large areas of starspot coverage, and they have intense and variable
                X-ray and radio emissions (approximately 1000 times that of the Sun). Many have extremely powerful
                stellar winds; some eject gas in high-velocity bipolar jets. Another source of brightness variability
                are clumps (protoplanets and planetesimals) in the disk surrounding T Tauri stars.Their spectra show a
                higher lithium abundance than the Sun and other main-sequence stars because lithium is destroyed at
                temperatures above 2,500,000 K. From a study of lithium abundances in 53 T Tauri stars, it has been
                found that lithium depletion varies strongly with size, suggesting that "lithium burning" by the P-P
                chain during the last highly convective and unstable stages during the later pre–main sequence phase of
                the Hayashi contraction may be one of the main sources of energy for T Tauri stars. Rapid rotation tends
                to improve mixing and increase the transport of lithium into deeper layers where it is destroyed. T
                Tauri stars generally increase their rotation rates as they age, through contraction and spin-up, as
                they conserve angular momentum. This causes an increased rate of lithium loss with age. Lithium burning
                will also increase with higher temperatures and mass, and will last for at most a little over 100
                million years</p>
            <p>Roughly half of T Tauri stars have circumstellar disks, which in this case are called protoplanetary
                discs because they are probably the progenitors of planetary systems like the Solar System.
                Circumstellar discs are estimated to dissipate on timescales of up to 10 million years. Most T Tauri
                stars are in binary star systems. In various stages of their life, they are called Young Stellar Objects
                (YSOs). It is thought that the active magnetic fields and strong solar wind of Alfvén waves of T Tauri
                stars are one means by which angular momentum gets transferred from the star to the protoplanetary disc.
                A T Tauri stage for the Solar System would be one means by which the angular momentum of the contracting
                Sun was transferred to the protoplanetary disc and hence, eventually to the planets.

                Analogs of T Tauri stars in the higher mass range (2–8 solar masses)—A and B spectral type
                pre–main-sequence stars, are called Herbig Ae/Be-type stars. More massive (>8 solar masses) stars in
                pre–main sequence stage are not observed, because they evolve very quickly: when they become visible
                (i.e. disperses surrounding circumstellar gas and dust cloud), the hydrogen in the center is already
                burning and they are main sequence objects.</p>

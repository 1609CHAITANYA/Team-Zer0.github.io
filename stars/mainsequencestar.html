            <p>In astronomy, the main sequence is a continuous and distinctive band of stars that appears on plots of
                stellar color versus brightness. These color-magnitude plots are known as Hertzsprung–Russell diagrams
                after their co-developers, Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell. Stars on this band are known as
                main-sequence stars or dwarf stars. These are the most numerous true stars in the universe, and include
                the Earth's Sun.
                After condensation and ignition of a star, it generates thermal energy in its dense core region through
                nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium. During this stage of the star's lifetime, it is located on the
                main sequence at a position determined primarily by its mass, but also based upon its chemical
                composition and age. The cores of main-sequence stars are in hydrostatic equilibrium, where outward
                thermal pressure from the hot core is balanced by the inward pressure of gravitational collapse from the
                overlying layers. The strong dependence of the rate of energy generation on temperature and pressure
                helps to sustain this balance. Energy generated at the core makes its way to the surface and is radiated
                away at the photosphere. The energy is carried by either radiation or convection, with the latter
                occurring in regions with steeper temperature gradients, higher opacity or both..</p>
            <p>The main sequence is sometimes divided into upper and lower parts, based on the dominant process that a
                star uses to generate energy. Stars below about 1.5 times the mass of the Sun (1.5 M☉) primarily fuse
                hydrogen atoms together in a series of stages to form helium, a sequence called the proton–proton chain.
                Above this mass, in the upper main sequence, the nuclear fusion process mainly uses atoms of carbon,
                nitrogen and oxygen as intermediaries in the CNO cycle that produces helium from hydrogen atoms.
                Main-sequence stars with more than two solar masses undergo convection in their core regions, which acts
                to stir up the newly created helium and maintain the proportion of fuel needed for fusion to occur.
                Below this mass, stars have cores that are entirely radiative with convective zones near the surface.
                With decreasing stellar mass, the proportion of the star forming a convective envelope steadily
                increases. Main-sequence stars below 0.4 M☉ undergo convection throughout their mass. When core
                convection does not occur, a helium-rich core develops surrounded by an outer layer of hydrogen.</p>
            <p>The majority of stars on a typical HR diagram lie along the main-sequence curve. This line is pronounced
                because both the spectral type and the luminosity depend only on a star's mass, at least to zeroth-order
                approximation, as long as it is fusing hydrogen at its core—and that is what almost all stars spend most
                of their "active" lives doing.[17]

                The temperature of a star determines its spectral type via its effect on the physical properties of
                plasma in its photosphere. A star's energy emission as a function of wavelength is influenced by both
                its temperature and composition. A key indicator of this energy distribution is given by the color
                index, B − V, which measures the star's magnitude in blue (B) and green-yellow (V) light by means of
                filters.[note 1] This difference in magnitude provides a measure of a star's temperature.</p>
            <p>Main-sequence stars are called dwarf stars,[18][19] but this terminology is partly historical and can be
                somewhat confusing. For the cooler stars, dwarfs such as red dwarfs, orange dwarfs, and yellow dwarfs
                are indeed much smaller and dimmer than other stars of those colors. However, for hotter blue and white
                stars, the difference in size and brightness between so-called "dwarf" stars that are on the main
                sequence and so-called "giant" stars that are not, becomes smaller. For the hottest stars the difference
                is not directly observable and for these stars the terms "dwarf" and "giant" refer to differences in
                spectral lines which indicate whether a star is on or off the main sequence. Nevertheless, very hot
                main-sequence stars are still sometimes called dwarfs, even though they have roughly the same size and
                brightness as the "giant" stars of that temperature.[20]

                The common use of "dwarf" to mean main sequence is confusing in another way, because there are dwarf
                stars which are not main-sequence stars. For example, a white dwarf is the dead core left over after a
                star has shed its outer layers, and is much smaller than a main-sequence star, roughly the size of
                Earth. These represent the final evolutionary stage of many main-sequence stars</p>

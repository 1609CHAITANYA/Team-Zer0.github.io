            <p>A red dwarf is the smallest and coolest kind of star on the main sequence. Red dwarfs are by far the most
                common type of star in the Milky Way, at least in the neighborhood of the Sun, but because of their low
                luminosity, individual red dwarfs cannot be easily observed. From Earth, not one star that fits the
                stricter definitions of a red dwarf is visible to the naked eye.[1] Proxima Centauri, the nearest star
                to the Sun, is a red dwarf, as are fifty of the sixty nearest stars. According to some estimates, red
                dwarfs make up three-quarters of the stars in the Milky Way.</p>
            <p>The coolest red dwarfs near the Sun have a surface temperature of ~2,000 K and the smallest have radii of
                ~9% that of the Sun, with masses about ~7.5% that of the Sun. These red dwarfs have spectral classes of
                L0 to L2. There is some overlap with the properties of brown dwarfs, since the most massive brown dwarfs
                at lower metallicity can be as hot as 3,600 K and have late M spectral types.</p>
            <p>Definitions and usage of the term "red dwarf" vary on how inclusive they are on the hotter and more
                massive end. One definition is synonymous with stellar M dwarfs (M-type main sequence stars), yielding a
                maximum temperature of 3,900 K and 0.6 M☉. One includes all stellar M-type main-sequence and all K-type
                main-sequence stars (K dwarf), yielding a maximum temperature of 5,200 K and 0.8 M☉. Some definitions
                include any stellar M dwarf and part of the K dwarf classification. Other definitions are also in use
                (see definition). Many of the coolest, lowest mass M dwarfs are expected to be brown dwarfs, not true
                stars, and so those would be excluded from any definition of red dwarf.</p>
            <p>Stellar models indicate that red dwarfs less than 0.35 M☉ are fully convective.[3] Hence the helium
                produced by the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen is constantly remixed throughout the star, avoiding
                helium buildup at the core, thereby prolonging the period of fusion. Low-mass red dwarfs therefore
                develop very slowly, maintaining a constant luminosity and spectral type for trillions of years, until
                their fuel is depleted. Because of the comparatively short age of the universe, no red dwarfs yet exist
                at advanced stages of evolution.</p>
            <p>Red dwarfs are very-low-mass stars.[15] As a result, they have relatively low pressures, a low fusion
                rate, and hence, a low temperature. The energy generated is the product of nuclear fusion of hydrogen
                into helium by way of the proton–proton (PP) chain mechanism. Hence, these stars emit relatively little
                light, sometimes as little as ​1⁄10,000 that of the Sun, although this would still imply a power output
                on the order of 1022 watts (10 trillion gigawatts). Even the largest red dwarfs (for example HD 179930,
                HIP 12961 and Lacaille 8760) have only about 10% of the Sun's luminosity.[16] In general, red dwarfs
                less than 0.35 M☉ transport energy from the core to the surface by convection. Convection occurs because
                of opacity of the interior, which has a high density compared to the temperature. As a result, energy
                transfer by radiation is decreased, and instead convection is the main form of energy transport to the
                surface of the star. Above this mass, a red dwarf will have a region around its core where convection
                does not occur.</p><p>Because low-mass red dwarfs are fully convective, helium does not accumulate at the core, and compared to larger stars such as the Sun, they can burn a larger proportion of their hydrogen before leaving the main sequence. As a result, red dwarfs have estimated lifespans far longer than the present age of the universe, and stars less than 0.8 M☉ have not had time to leave the main sequence. The lower the mass of a red dwarf, the longer the lifespan. It is believed that the lifespan of these stars exceeds the expected 10-billion-year lifespan of our Sun by the third or fourth power of the ratio of the solar mass to their masses; thus, a 0.1 M☉ red dwarf may continue burning for 10 trillion years.[15][19] As the proportion of hydrogen in a red dwarf is consumed, the rate of fusion declines and the core starts to contract. The gravitational energy released by this size reduction is converted into heat, which is carried throughout the star by convectio.According to computer simulations, the minimum mass a red dwarf must have to eventually evolve into a red giant is 0.25 M☉; less massive objects, as they age, would increase their surface temperatures and luminosities becoming blue dwarfs and finally white dwarfs.</p>
